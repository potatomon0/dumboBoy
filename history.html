        <h1>Dumbo Boy's story:</h1>
        <p1>Dumbo boy is a domestic longhair male adopted from
            <a href="https://bestfriends.org/new-york-city" target="_blank">Best Friends Lifesaving Center</a> on May 27 2022.
            We were not expecting to adopt anyone on our first visit but we left with him. Although unprepared,
            we were able to pull it off with our well stocked local RiteAid...

        <h3>First week of coming home:</h3>
            <p2>He was given anxiety medicine to help him cope with new environment but we were not able to trick
            him into taking it in any kind of food we mix it with. Luckily, he doesn't need it. He was enjoying
            pets on the 2nd day and purr so much everyone can hear him. Although he hid behind the heater for the
            entire time, it was surprising was that he started showing his belly on day 3. I think he is coping well,
            and VERY well behaved but I remain skeptical since the animal rescue service told me his previous family
            had to surrender him due to his "destructive tendency."

        <h3>Months later:</h3>
        <p3>So far I noticed him nibbling on cardboard boxes and scratches my fabric storage box, he is
            quite sneaky about it but I caught him in the act a few times. Overall, these small damages are common in
            having a cat. He does not pee or poo anywhere outside the litterbox nor does he damage wooden walls or doors.
            He is a very sweet boy, comes over when called and loves to greet us by nudging his head on our hands.
            He is very shy with strangers and can take a while to warm up but can be easily bribed with some food and pets.
            He is very mellow for a cat, he does not scratch or bite when a stranger pet him. It is very helpful for the
            visitor to pet him.
